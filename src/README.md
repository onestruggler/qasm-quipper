# LinguaQuanta Libraries

The LinguaQuanta project is divided into two libraries. The `LinguaQuanta`
library provides (primarily) pure functions to facilitate parsing, analysis,
program transformation, and program translation. The `LinguaQuantaExe`
library is an internal library which provides (primarily) impure functions for
use across the LinguaQuanta executables (e.g., argument parsing and IO
processing utilities).
